# 🌟 Elden Ring Builds - Boss Build Recommender 🌟 #

## 📖 Description

Elden Ring Builds is an application developed in Spring Boot aimed at providing character build recommendations for Elden Ring players. By entering the name of a boss, the application suggests the best build to face it, considering weapons, spells, talismans, and optimized strategies.

The application is based on a database with information about bosses and builds, and the only GET endpoint returns the recommended builds for the selected boss.
---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java**: Main programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the backend application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database interaction.
- **MySQL**: Relational database.
- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine for rendering HTML pages.
- **JPA (Hibernate)**: For object-relational mapping.

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure the following programs are installed:

- **Java 17+**
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **MySQL** (or any compatible database)
- **Docker** (optional for running in containers)

---

### 1️⃣ Configuração do Banco de Dados

- **Create the database** `eldenringbuilds`  in your MySQL.
-Configure the environment variables in the `.env`. file.
- The program only runs with the database, if you want you can create yours, or search on internet a data base with bosses, their weakness and resistences.
- to work properly, you will need a table builds, with some builds, and the essencial column "tipo_dano" that means type of dmg, if its ice dmg, fire dmg.

Exemple:

```env
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/eldenringbuilds
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```
---

2️⃣ Application Setup
The application uses the application.properties file for database configuration. 
The environment variables are automatically read from.env

---

3️⃣ Running the Application
To run the application, simply execute:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or generate the .jar and run:

```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/eldenringbuilds-1.0.0.jar
```
The application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

---
🧑‍💻 Main Functionality:

🔥 Endpoint - Build Recommendation
GET /api/builds/{bossName}

This endpoint returns a recommended build based on the provided boss name. Example:
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/builds/malenia
```
Exemple:
```json
{
  "nome": "Malenia",
  "arma": "Greatsword",
  "magias": "Flame, Grant Me Strength",
  "talismas": "Radagon's Scarseal",
  "estrategia": "Use fire-based attacks to exploit Malenia's weakness."
}
```
