# 🌟 Elden Ring Builds - Boss Build Recommender 🌟 #

## 📖 Description

Elden Ring Builds is an application developed in Spring Boot aimed at providing character build recommendations for Elden Ring players. By entering the name of a boss, the application suggests the best build to face it, considering weapons, spells, talismans, and optimized strategies.

The application is based on a database with information about bosses and builds, and the only GET endpoint returns the recommended builds for the selected boss.

### 1️⃣ Database Configuration
